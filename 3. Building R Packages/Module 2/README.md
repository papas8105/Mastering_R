The purpose of this assessment is to document some R functions using __roxygen2__ style 
comments that would eventually be translated into R documentation files. For this 
assignment you do NOT need to build an entire package nor do you need to write any R
code. You only need to document the functions in the supplied R script. The functions 
are already written for you, you just have to write the documentation in __roxygen2__ 
style.
